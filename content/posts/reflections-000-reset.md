It's been a while since I've written.

Usually I'm not the 'put my life on the internet' type but this habit of writing and posting I'm forcing myself to undergo is meant for me. I need to do things I don't particularly enjoy or like to do.

It's been quite a year, usually people will wait till January to "start something new" but I've spent 3 years in December. Regardless, now I'm back, here's the new focus - **Building. Doing.**

I've dabbled in various projects, new frameworks, ideas but never stuck in and got over that bump of initial difficulty to truly execute. "Learnt" but never with true conviction of applying knowledge, the real test of learning is in its applications so as I learn new things I'll write about it and as I have big reflections I'll make posts such as this.

In some private notes I've noticed a few super powers of this exercise:

1. Clarifies your own thinking
2. Creates serendipity
3. Gives you a goal of something you HAVE TO DO, everyday.

So what will I write about?

1. **[Work]** - Projects, tech, real estate or like right now I'm deep in the agents rabbit hole - more on that soon. All my daily learnings in applications of the world that I'm trying to create value for people (hopefully).
2. **[Culture]** - Food, Cooking, Travel, it's been a while but I need to get the fuck out of my head and really live.
3. **[Reflections]** - mostly shit like this.
4. **[Learnings]** - Mostly Books reviews and the occasional Physics summary.

Anyway, here's to something new.
