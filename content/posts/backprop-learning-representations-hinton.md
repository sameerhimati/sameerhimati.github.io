*Rating: 2/5*

Here is probably the most seminal paper that laid the foundation for all deep learning. It was the original paper that introduced back propagation as a learning mechanism for perceptrons. This paper is heavy on the theory but it presents the formulas every student learns within the first few weeks of a course in deep learning.

**Recommended Read:** Although its a very important and historically significant paper that has influenced deep learning as we know it; I would only recommend it as a read for individuals who want to gain some context for the origins of Deep Learning, hence a 2 out of 5 rating. If you want to learn back propagation there are a lot better resources for that, my favorite being [this video by 3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ilg3gGewQ5U).
