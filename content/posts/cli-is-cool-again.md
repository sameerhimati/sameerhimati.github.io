I've been using Claude Code since its launch a year ago but really been working with skills and agents for around a month now. It's been a game changer in the amount of work I've been able to ship. 

In the last 40 days alone I've shipped an iOS app, an end-to-end hosted web app for a client and multiple smaller projects to help small parts of my daily life. I've also managed to plan out the next projects I want to work on and had clarity as to how they need to work. 

This is all via the command line, no more GUIs and fancy web interfaces. It's almost like we are coming full circle with the formation of the computer again with interaction in a command line. All my commands and instructions to coding agents and the monitoring of tasks happen via a terminal window (well multiple) and a few markdown files. 

Its just cool to see what is happening, idk if its everyone but at least me. 

Anyway thats it, just wanted to write this down. 

Gonna try to add a post/write up like this with every project now, kinda like a note to self as to what the point of this was. 

Carpe Diem.
